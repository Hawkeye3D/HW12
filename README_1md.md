In this assignment, you will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following outlines what you need to do.

**Method of Approach**

The first step in a project like this is to organize it.  This is called setting up an interface, defining what needs to done in order to finish the task.  Although there is not a formal way to do that using what I know now with Python, the idea is still useful.  So what I have done here, is read over the instructions and broken it down so that I set up a blank project with all of the components I will need to fill in.   I am conceptually thinking in terms of view, view-model and model for this type of project.  What this means is that I can separate work on each of the major components of the project, so they are not dependent upon one another, although they will be linked together.  I can set up the final output , the 'view' component, so that all I need do is fill in the blanks later once I have finished the' view-model' component, aka business logic.  The 'model' is MongoDB in this case, and that is how the data will be stored. (The view-model links the view to the model more or less)

My approach to this is to define, via VS Code all of the components, including this README, as a git project, HW12 and then start working on each component.  I will work on the things that I know best, first, getting them out of the way, and work my way through the list.  

The following does not represent the order in which I have done the project, but the order which best explains how this MVVM pattern works.
